## Code style

This project uses a modified version of Google's Java Style. These should be used automatically via
`.idea/codeStyles/Project.xml`. If that is not working then import `GoogleStyle_customized.xml`
into IntelliJ to use it. The differences are below. (Or run
`diff ./other/intellij-java-google-style.xml ./other/GoogleStyle_customized.xml` instead.)
